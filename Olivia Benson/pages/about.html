                I strive to demonstrate the highest level of integrity and commitment, and to bring a little fun into every real estate transaction. 
                I've lived here all my life and I love Johannesburg as much as I love my job!

                As the trusted real estate advisor for my clients, I understand that selling and/or buying a home is complex and deeply personal. 
                There is also a lot at stake financially and personally. This perspective on the process and the responsibility felt towards my 
                clients drives me to truly be an expert at the job. I understand the market, the players, and all of the variables involved in a 
                real estate transaction. I want to make sure you feel supported and that you have a trusted advisor by your side.
                </p>

                <p>
                <span class="body-copy-h">Humble Beginnings.</span>
                In 2015, I launched my real estate career by creating and filming Johannesburg's first real estate Day in The Life documentary 
                series about the ins and out of the real estate market.
                </p>

                <p>
                My reputation amongst my peers is as a well-respected industry innovator and early adopter of social media and digital marketing 
                for real estate. My team and I work hard to keep ahead of the curve, combining luxury home styling with technology and 
                forward-thinking. I've spent the past 6 years excelling in the competitive landscape of Johannesburg real estate and worked 
                behind the scenes with hundreds of other real estate agents.

                <span class="body-copy-h">More about me.</span>
                I graduated from Jeppe High School for Girls in Kensington, and at UNISA with a degree in Public Relations and Communication. 
                It was a well-rounded education that taught me to think critically. Side note: I was the captain of our women's rugby team 
                too and played “second row”.
                </p>

                <p>
                <span class="body-copy-h">My secret sauce.</span>
                The reason for the 5 star client reviews, is directness, transparency, stylish home staging and compelling listing marketing, 
                expert negotiatons, and the ability to keep people and deals on track — calmly and professionally. This ability is part 
                natural instinct and part commitment to advanced, ongoing training and education. A lot of what agents do sound similar on 
                paper. What varies (significantly) is how they do it and the resulting outcomes for their clients.
                </p>

                <p>
                I've renovated homes, worked on development projects, and staged, marketed and sold over 500 homes for my clients. As an 
                aspiring flâneuse, I am a good person to ask for food, wine, shopping and travel tips. In fact, I can't wait to take you out 
                to celebrate after the close of our sale!
                </p>

                <p>
                In terms of real estate, my team and I are committed to lifelong learning. Our education is never complete. As a licensed 
                Broker (as opposed to Salesperson), I continually invest time, money and thought into the latest sales, marketing and 
                especially, negotiations techniques. Everyone on our team is smart, educated, experienced and dedicated to continual improvement.
                </p>

                <p>
                On a personal note, I care very deply about my client's individual situation, goals, and dreams. Johannesburg real estate is exciting,
                challenging and often exhilarating. It's not for the faint of heart!
                </p>

                <p>
                If you'd like to work together, please reach out. I look forward to getting to know you and i'm here to help achieve your goal.
