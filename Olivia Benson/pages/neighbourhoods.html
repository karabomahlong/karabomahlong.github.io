                The Johannesburg South Neighbourhood includes the suburbs of Bassonia, Glenvista, Lenasia, Oakdene, Winchester Hills 
                and Mulbarton. Although the area is being developed fast, Johannesburg South still retains much of its natural beauty. 
                With the endless hills disappearing into the horizon, and many exclusive wildlife estates, one might imagine being in 
                a nature reserve. "The South", as it is most commonly referred to by the locals, is mainly divided into two main 
                parts - the older part on the north side of the N12, and the newer part on the south of the highway. The people of 
                "the South" are family-orientated and active.

                Its extremely scenic, and there are quite a number of good restaurants. The people of “The South” are considered 
                to be very health conscious - so a lot of fitness facilities including gyms, clubs in terms of cycling clubs, running 
                clubs, pilates and yoga clubs are available.

                Above and beyond the safety and security offered by estate living in Johannesburg, it has become a welcoming addition
                to many lifestyles. From golfers to eco-living, there's an estate in the city's boundaries that's set to cater to your
                needs. The latest trend with estate living in Johannesburg is that these residential offerings are no longer reserved 
                for the top 1% of society. Recent developments have brought highly affordable cluster and apartment offerings within 
                these gated communities, offering residents all the facilities of the lifestyle estate but within reach of a young 
                professional's budget.

                Estate living in Johannesburg has become more affordable in recent years with many of these estates adding apartment 
                development to their plates. Looking at the success of The Village at the Eye Of Africa Estate in the south of 
                Johannesburg, which comprises of 12 apartment blocks, with eight two- or three-bedroom apartments in each block. 
                Sales have gone exceptionally well. Within weeks of Phase 1 of the launch, 80% of the first apartment block was sold.
