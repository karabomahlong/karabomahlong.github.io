            When you make a move, you want to sell your house for the highest price possible and working with an agent to set the right asking 
            price is critical, as pricing it too high or too low could have a negative impact on your final sale.

               <p>
                Before anything else, it's a good idea to sit down and clarify your motivations and draw up a basic time frame for the selling 
                process. Being clear about your intentions for selling will make it easier for us to determine the most appropriate option for your 
                specified financial lifestyle, and real estate goals.
                </p>    

                <p>
                I'll then visit your property and give you an accurate comparative market analysis  to establish the fair market value of your home 
                based on factors like your property's features and recent sales activity in your neighbourhood. Then together we'll decide on the 
                best selling price. Furthermore, recommendations of any potential improvements or staging to maximise your home's value will be made.
                </p>

                <p>
                While everyone has clutter, buyers want to see a fantasy version of your house, in which they can envision living. Once your home is 
                on the market you'll need to keep it as neat as possible. One way to make that easier is to reduce the amount of clutter you have on 
                your shelves and surfaces. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Improving your home in preparation for viewing is essential. While you don't necessarily want to do a major, expensive renovation 
                project before you sell, you can make minor repairs and improvements that will make your home look fresher to buyers. Try things such 
                as replacing the caulk and grout in your bathroom, updating old or rusted ceiling fans and light fixtures, and changing switch plates, 
                doorknobs and other hardware for a clean and neat appearance. Consider painting your front door and trim even if your rooms don't 
                need new paint.
                </p>

                <p> 
                Having a detailed marketing plan will make a big difference in how quickly your home sells and how much of a profit you'll realise.
                </p>
                
                <ul class="marketing-list">
                    <span class="body-copy-h">Marketing</span>
                    <li>
                    Your home will be professionally photographed and a video property tour will be made so that local and especially international 
                    buyers can get a better feel for the home before they view the home in person.</li>

                    <li>Just Listed flyers will be distributed to your neighbourhoods.</li>

                    <li>
                    Your home will be advertised on all major local property websites (Property 24, Private Property, etc) as well as direct marketing 
                    to a pool of exclusive buyers.</li>

                    <li>Open houses will be scheduled and held at your convenience.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                However If you plan to buy another home, an important decision to make is whether to sell your home first or make an offer on a new 
                home before putting yours on the market. I can help you evaluate how fast homes are selling in the market and help you estimate how 
                long it will take you to <a href="../listings/sale.html">find a home.</a> This decision also depends on your financing, so you may want to consult with a lender to see 
                how you can finance the transition from one home to another if you choose not to sell your home first.
                </p>
